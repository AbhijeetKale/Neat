# Neat
NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks. For a detailed description of the algorithm, you should probably [read this paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).

## c#
An implementation of NEAT in c# with .Net framework 4.7.2 (The code can be compiled with any .Net lib, just a few functions might need changing).
## JAVA
Current implementation of Neat in java is present in the [FlappyBIrd repo](https://github.com/AbhijeetKale/FlappyBird/tree/master/bin).
The code is old and very inefficient though. I will be porting the c# algo code to java once it is finished.
